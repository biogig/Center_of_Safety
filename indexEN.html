        <h2 id="about">About Center</h2>
        <div class="center">
            <p>Analysis of the consequences of various emergency situations shows that in more than 80% of cases the cause of death is the “human factor.”</p><br>
            <p> Today there is no doubt that the solution to the problem of human safety largely depends on persistent preventive work, first of all, on educating the population in the basics of safe behavior.</p><br>
             <p>The Ministry of Emergency Situations is carrying out targeted work to create educational safety centers in the Republic of Belarus.</p><br>
            <p> To date, ten security centers of the Ministry of Emergency Situations have been created and are functioning in the republic: in the Gomel region (based on the Lyceum at the University of Civil Defense of the Ministry of Emergency Situations), Vitebsk, Lida (Grodno region), Brest, Stolin ( Brest region), Mogilev, Borisov (Minsk region), Baran (Vitebsk region), Novopolotsk (Vitebsk region) and Minsk.</p><br>
            <p> The main purpose of the educational centers is to teach the population the correct actions in the event of various emergency situations. With the help of innovative technologies and simulators, visitors to the center have the opportunity to practice practical rescue and self-rescue skills. The expositions of security centers are built with maximum transmission of reality based on modern information technologies, using the digital environment, augmented and virtual reality technologies.</p><br>
            


            <p>Training at the center is based on the principles of play. The basis is based on methods of immersing students in an environment that maximally simulates an emergency situation, and in-depth study of the material by increasing the emotional perception of the simulated situation. The center uses interactive trainers and simulators created on the basis of modern information communication technologies (virtual reality, augmented reality, Internet of things, computer vision, etc.).</p> <br>
            <p>The center features more than 30 interactive training platforms that allow training in the following areas: </p><br>
            <ul>
             <li>transport security;</li>
             <li>safety in emergency situations;</li>
             <li>civil defense;</li>
             <li>fire safety;</li>
             <li>environmental safety;</li>
             <li>security in ecosystems;</li>
             <li>criminal security;</li>
             <li>healthy lifestyle;</li>
             <li>dangerous meteorological phenomena;</li>
             <li>nuclear and radiation safety;</li>
             <li>industrial safety.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>The center allows you to organize training at a high level: practice actions in emergency situations, increase the level of life safety, and form the correct behavior. The skills acquired will help maintain health and reduce the loss of life.</p><br>
            <p>At the end of the training, anyone can use specialized software to independently test their knowledge in the field of life safety and plan further training at the center.</p>
